## Aureus Engine ‚Äî 3-Material Modeling Logic (Reverse Engineering)

### üîí Canvas Edit Protocol

- Canvas edits will now follow a strict proposal-first workflow.
- All suggested logic, constraint, or structure updates must be explicitly approved before being applied.
- Suggested edits will be shown as:
  > **üìù Proposed Canvas Change** *(Not yet applied ‚Äî awaiting approval)*
- Only upon user confirmation will the proposed change be committed.
- Exception: routine formatting or emergency error correction may be handled immediately when context clearly requires it.
- This safeguard does not interfere with dataset analysis or modeling continuity ‚Äî it strictly governs the logic canvas.

### ‚úÖ Analysis Plan for Tier-Deviation Coefficient Model (2- and 3-Material Recipes)

---

### PHASE 1: Dataset Ingestion (2- and 3-Material)

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Terminology Protection

- The term **‚Äútemplate‚Äù** refers exclusively to the special `TEMPLATE` fragment used in certain 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-material recipes.
- It designates the final material position (if present) with disproportionate influence on shaping logic.
- The word ‚Äútemplate‚Äù must **not** be used to describe curve shapes, modeling patterns, deviation profiles, or output structures.
- Alternative terms such as ‚Äúoutput profile,‚Äù ‚Äúcurve shape,‚Äù or ‚Äúfingerprint‚Äù must be used in all non-fragment contexts.

**Input Requirements:**

- Each entry must contain:
  - A 2-tier or 3-tier recipe string (e.g., "PC" or "PCF")
  - An output distribution: six floats in canonical tier order `[P, C, F, X, E, Y]`, summing to 100.0

**Input Validation Rules:**

- Recipe string must include exactly 2 or 3 tiers from `{P, C, F, X, E, Y}`
- All six output values must be valid floats, two decimal places, and total between 99.99‚Äì100.01

**Important:** This analysis applies **only** to 2- or 3-material recipes that use **BASE-only** fragments (no TEMPLATE position). Other 3-material recipes **with TEMPLATE fragments** are **excluded** from this phase and must be handled separately.

---

### PHASE 2: Recipe Normalization

- Parse input recipe into a list of quality tiers `Q1`, `Q2`, `Q3`, etc.
- Identify the true **minimum tier** from the original input using the canonical tier index (not alphabetically or by order of appearance)
  - Example: In recipe `('C', 'P', 'X')`, quality `P` has the lowest canonical index (0), so it is the true minimum and assigned deviation = 0 ‚Äî not `C`
- Map each quality tier to its canonical index:
  ```
  tier_map = { 'P': 0, 'C': 1, 'F': 2, 'X': 3, 'E': 4, 'Y': 5 }
  ```
- Determine the minimum tier index (`min_idx`)
- Compute deviation for each quality input: `deviation = tier_index - min_idx`

---

### PHASE 3: Contribution Weighting

- üîí **Structural Integrity Rule:** After projection, all tiers between the minimum and maximum tier **must** contain non-zero values. If any intermediate tier has a weight of 0.0, a small placeholder (e.g., `0.01`) will be injected prior to normalization to enforce validity.

- **Coefficient Range Constraint:** Tunable weights `x‚ÇÅ‚Äìx‚ÇÖ` are provisionally bounded (0.01‚Äì5.0). These bounds are empirical and subject to adjustment.

- **Deviation-to-Weight Mapping:**

  - Deviation 0 ‚Üí weight = 1.00 (provisionally fixed)
  - Deviations 1‚Äì5 ‚Üí weights = `x‚ÇÅ‚Äìx‚ÇÖ` (tunable)

- **Repeated Tier Handling:**

  - If repeated tier is the **minimum**, each instance contributes 1.00 independently
  - If repeated tier is **above the minimum**, each instance is weighted by its individual deviation

- **Deviation Attribution Rule:** Each fragment must be assigned a deviation relative to the true minimum and evaluated independently. BASE tier order is ignored, but per-fragment attribution is required.

- **Failsafe Enforcement:**

  - Predictions must include **non-zero weights for all intermediate tiers** (i.e., all canonical tier indices between the min and max tier must be represented)
  - After weight calculation but before final normalization, the model must forcibly insert a minimum placeholder value (e.g., 0.01) into any missing intermediate tier to ensure output validityFragment collapsing or omission is not allowed

---

### PHASE 4: Output Vector Generation (3-Material Only)

---

### PHASE 4A: Deviation Profile Isolation (2-Material Recipes)

#### ‚úÖ Canonical Profile Alignment Rule

- All 2-material predictions must use a **direct lookup from canonical output profiles** based on the deviation signature `(0, X)`.
- These output profiles have been verified to produce 100% valid matches across all known 2-material combinations.
- No Gaussian shaping, fitted polynomial, or COM-derived distribution generation is permitted in 2-material logic.
- The curve must be aligned to the correct tier anchors (min ‚Üí index 0) and reshaped only by **tier offset**, not shape logic.
- This method has full deterministic parity with the game system and is locked in as the official model for 2-material shaping.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Error-Proofing Constraints for Canonical Curve Analysis

1. **Averaging Restrictions**

   - Do **not** average output distributions for recipes sharing a deviation signature. If multiple recipes with the same deviation signature yield differing shapes after tier-zero alignment, this is not grounds for averaging ‚Äî it is grounds for an immediate halt and dataset integrity check.
   - All recipes with a shared deviation signature are expected to yield **identical output shapes**, tier-shifted as necessary. If this does not hold, the canonical dataset must be verified.
   - Averaging must never mix curves whose actual tier ranges differ (e.g., `P‚ÜíY` vs `C‚ÜíY`) unless they have first been normalized to a shared alignment baseline.
   - Min‚Äìmax tier anchors are used to track the curve's true tier location but do **not define separate deviation signatures** ‚Äî they constrain alignment, not classification.
   - Structural similarity (e.g., curve shape) is not a valid criterion alone unless tier positions are explicitly aligned before comparison.
   - Structural similarity (e.g., curve shape) is not a valid criterion alone unless tier positions are explicitly aligned before comparison.

2. **Tier Anchor Preservation**

   - For all deviation signatures, the **minimum and maximum tier values** are considered tier anchors.
   - Both anchors must be tracked explicitly and preserved in all shape comparisons, alignment logic, and output evaluations.
   - Canonical curves must be stored or evaluated in context of their actual tier bounds (e.g., `P‚ÜíY` vs `C‚ÜíY`).

3. **Canonical Supremacy Rule**

   - If a verified canonical output curve exists for any recipe, it must be used directly without modification or substitution.
   - Do not attempt to recreate or approximate a canonical output from neighboring recipes.

4. **Shape Alignment Requirement**

   - Output curves must be **tier-zero aligned** (minimum tier normalized to index 0) before evaluating shape, center of mass, or skew behavior.

5. **No Deviation-Only Grouping**

   - Deviation signature `(0, X)` alone is insufficient for grouping curves unless their outputs have been normalized to a common tier baseline.
   - Tier anchors (e.g., `P‚ÜíY` vs `C‚ÜíY`) do **not define new deviation signatures**, but must be respected for proper output alignment and validation.

These safeguards must apply to **all deviation signatures** and **all material combinations**, not just examples like `(0, 4)` and `(0, 5)`. This ensures fully general, tier-anchored accuracy across the shaping kernel.

#### üìä Observed Behavioral Patterns from 2-Material Canonical Data

1. **Perfect Symmetry Confirmed**
   - Inputs such as ["P", "Y"] and ["Y", "P"] produce **identical output curves**
   - No reversal or reordering is necessary ‚Äî game outputs are **invariant to input order** for 2-material recipes

2. **Deviation Signature Governs Distribution Shape**
   - All recipes with the same tier deviation (e.g., `(0, 2)`) produce **identical curve shapes**, differing only in tier placement (i.e., anchor-shifted along the output vector)
   - Output skew consistently favors the **lower tier** in all valid tier gaps

3. **Higher Deviations Increase Spread and Lower Center Mass**
   - As tier distance increases (e.g., from `(0, 1)` to `(0, 4)`), output distribution shifts more weight to edges and away from center
   - `(0, 4)` profiles show sharp skew toward the lower tier with balanced tails

4. **Flat Profiles Never Occur**
   - No canonical shape is uniform across tiers (other than exact match `(0, 0)`)
   - Even mirrored-tier inputs always resolve into **directionally-weighted** curves

5. **Repeatability and Determinism Confirmed**
   - No input pair showed unstable, random, or ambiguous shaping
   - Dataset demonstrates **deterministic 1-to-1 mapping** from tier pair ‚Üí output curve

These patterns are now considered ground truth for informing and constraining 3-material logic in Phase 4.

```

- This phase applies only to 2-material BASE-only recipes.

- Output distributions will be grouped by **deviation signature** only after tier-zero alignment confirms structural identity. If shapes diverge after alignment, the group must be flagged for canonical verification ‚Äî no averaging or shape inference is permitted.

- Each 2-material recipe has only two fragments, so possible deviation signatures are:

  - `(0, 0)`  ‚Üí Uniform-tier inputs (e.g. "CC") ‚Üí Always 100% of that tier
  - `(0, 1)`  ‚Üí One-tier difference (e.g. "CF")
  - `(0, 2)`  ‚Üí Two-tier difference (e.g. "CX")
  - `(0, 3)`  ‚Üí Three-tier difference (e.g. "CE")
  - `(0, 4)`  ‚Üí Four-tier difference (e.g. "CY")
  - `(0, 5)`  ‚Üí Five-tier difference (e.g. "PY")

- Each deviation profile will be evaluated for:

  - Output shape stability across mirrored inputs
  - Output skew relative to minimum and maximum tier
  - Scaling characteristics (if any)

- Once deviation profile behavior is confirmed and deterministic, extracted constants or patterns will be used to inform more complex 3-material modeling.
