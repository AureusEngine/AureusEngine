  "Canonical Structural Rules (1\u201316)": [
    "1. Template warp scales with dt, capped via exponential decay",
    "2. Arc spillover must be pushed inward, never discarded",
    "3. Template tier = Y does not guarantee bin 5 dominance",
    "4. Template at anchor (dt = 0) has zero additional weighted influence",
    "5. Uniform inputs = locked 100% bin",
    "6. Base position commutativity is absolute",
    "7. Canonical kernel is exponential arc centered on deviation",
    "8. Anchor alignment is required for shape comparison",
    "9. Anchor bin dominance overrides weak template influence",
    "10. Dual-lobed shaping arises from arc interference",
    "11. Flattening occurs when mid-bin arcs collide (dt \u2248 base_dev)",
    "12. Template only dominates if dt > all base deviations",
    "13. Mid-bin shaping wins when base and template deviate similarly",
    "14. Mirror signatures with same roles must yield same shape",
    "15. Warp influence saturates at dt \u2265 5 per exponential law",
    "16. Warp activation is smooth from dt = 1 onward (no step)"

  "Role-Based Deviation Logic": {
    "Deviation Assignment": "Deviations are assigned as: d1 = Input1 - anchor, d2 = Input2 - anchor, dt = Template - anchor",
    "Template Role Fixity": "Template is always the third material and maps to dt in signature",
    "Anchor Computation": "Anchor = min(tier1, tier2, template_tier)",
    "Valid Bin Range": "Output bins are constrained to [anchor, max tier] inclusive; all overflow is redistributed inward",
    "Dev-0 Role Tracking": "The engine must explicitly track which roles (base1, base2, template) are at dev=0",
    "Signature Comparison": "Signature similarity must be based on anchor-aligned deviation sets, not absolute tiers or positions",
    "Warp Precedence Rule": "Warp only activates when dt > all base deviations; otherwise base shaping dominates"
