They inform deviation signature structure, shaping behavior, and prediction logic.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Canonical Deviation Signature Behavior (2-Material)\n\nEach 2-material recipe contains only two input tiers. The lower tier is always assigned deviation `0`, and the higher tier deviation `d`, where `1 <= d <= 5`. The resulting signature is always of the form `(0, d)`.\n\nExamples:\n- \"PP\" \u2192 `(0, 0)` \u2192 Always returns `[100, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n- \"PF\" \u2192 `(0, 2)` \u2192 Returns canonical curve for deviation 2\n- \"PY\" \u2192 `(0, 5)` \u2192 Returns canonical curve for deviation 5\n\nAll deviation signature detection and shaping logic must be based on unordered inputs, correctly identifying and assigning deviations from the minimum quality tier, regardless of the input order.\n\nAdditional observation:\n- Although the minimum-quality fragment exerts the dominant pull on the output shape, the maximum-tier fragment also contributes skew \u2014 but to a **lesser degree**. This disproves symmetric shaping logic and supports deviation-weighted curve contribution instead.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcd0 Output Profile Shape Logic\n\nAll output profiles:\n- Must be tier-zero aligned to the minimum input tier\n- Must contain **non-zero values** for **all tiers between min and max**\n- Must sum to exactly `100%`\n- Are deterministic per deviation signature\n\nAdditionally:\n- All shaping and adjustment calculations must be constrained to the tier range `[min(input), max(input)]`\n- The maximum tier value must be **included** by allowing contribution up to but not including `max + 1`\n- The minimum tier must include its full range, beginning at `min`\n- Any predicted value outside this range must be forcibly set to `0.0`\n- Adjustment vectors must be **realigned** to start at the true minimum tier before being applied\n- Any weight, coefficient, or adjustment contributing beyond the maximum tier must be invalidated\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd10 Verified Deviation Signatures\n\n| Deviation Signature | Canonical Output Profile                  | Canonical Example |\n| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------- |\n| (0, 0)              | [100.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]          | ['PP']            |\n| (0, 1)              | [60.0, 40.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]          | ['PC']            |\n| (0, 2)              | [57.14, 14.29, 28.57, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]      | ['PF']            |\n| (0, 3)              | [50.0, 20.0, 10.0, 20.0, 0.0, 0.0]        | ['PX']            |\n| (0, 4)              | [42.86, 21.43, 14.29, 7.14, 14.29, 0.0]   | ['PE']            |\n| (0, 5)              | [36.84, 21.05, 15.79, 10.53, 5.26, 10.53] | ['PY']            |\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Next Generation Shaping Strategy (Curve-First Modeling)\n\n- Each material contributes a probability distribution curve based on its tier deviation.\n- These curves are summed, then integrated across tier windows.\n- The result is normalized and output as a 6-slot quality distribution.\n\nThis model ensures canonical matching with no lookup required.\n\n    "
